# Cingo
I've been trying to learn [go](https://go.dev) by writting a simple command line based client for [Cinemana](https://cinemana.shabakaty.com), using standard go packages and [huh](https://github.com/charmbracelet/huh).

### Why when there's a website?.
The website seems to be using a lot of javascript which slows it down a lot, and it's easier for me personally to use a cli app on my terminal.

Also [mpv](https://mpv.io) is the coolest video player.

### Notes
- This is an experimental personal project.
- Obviously not an official client.
- This is merely a client I have no affilation with the media providers available within cinemana.
- [Cinemana](https://cinemana.shabakaty.com) is mainly available within Iraq.
- Requires [mpv](https://mpv.io) to work.

### Instructions
- Get the source code:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/JUGYx/cingo && cd cingo
```
- Run it:
```sh
go run .
```
- Or build it:
```sh
go build .
```
